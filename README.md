# Metabase Upload/Download Utility

Transferring Metabase collections from one instance to another is a pain. This script automates that. First, download your collection with `download.py`, then upload it to a new instance using `upload.py`. You will need to change the BASE, USERNAME, PASSWORD, COLLECTION etc. constants in the file before running.
